    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the big cats in the Felidae family and a member of genus Panthera. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range countries declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.</p>

    <p>The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes lion populations in Africa. It is the second-largest living cat after the tiger, with some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, barring hybrids like the liger. In ancient times, the modern lion's range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India.</p>
